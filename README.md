Yamaha Website Redesign – Before & After Description

Before (Existing Design):
Original Yamaha website layout was more content-heavy and visually cluttered, especially on the homepage. Important elements like product highlights, features, and call-to-action buttons were not immediately noticeable. The navigation felt slightly outdated, and the overall design lacked a strong visual hierarchy, which affected user engagement—especially for first-time visitors.

After My Design
In the redesigned version, I focused on creating a clean, modern, and user-centric interface.

Introduced a strong hero/banner section with clear visuals and branding

Redesigned the layout using cards and sections to improve readability

Improved visual hierarchy by prioritizing key information and CTAs

Enhanced consistency in typography, spacing, and alignment

Made the design more responsive and engaging, aligning with Yamaha’s bold and sporty brand identity

Result:
The redesigned website offers a better user experience, faster visual understanding of products, and a more premium, modern feel, making it more appealing to users and aligned with current UI/UX standards.
